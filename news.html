        <h4>The Weeknd: The Real Reason He’s Not Reaching Out To Selena Gomez After Her Breakdown</h4>
        <p>Selena Gomez checked into rehab for mental health treatment, but her ex The Weeknd isn’t planning to reach out to her. Here’s why.
 
         Selena Gomez checked into rehab after suffering an “emotional breakdown” in a hospital on Oct. 10, but there are a few people who won’t be checking up on her as she receives treatment. The Weeknd, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, is one of those people. “Abel has not reached out to Selena, or her family, and he has no intentions of doing so right now,” a source close to The Weeknd tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. “Do not take that as meaning he doesn’t care though, because he does – of course he does – he just doesn’t want to potentially stir the pot or unintentionally cause any more issues for Selena.”
         “It’s not like Selena is dealing with this on her own — if she was, then it might be different — but, Abel knows she has a loving support network around her looking out for her best interests, so it would serve no purpose for him to wade in too,” the insider continues. “When Selena finishes treatment and she’s regained her emotional wellbeing, Abel may reach out to her then with a nice email. But for now he’s steering clear, which is probably the wisest thing he could possibly do because this is about Selena right now, not Abel.

        <h4>Drake Confesses He Wanted To Start A Family With Rihanna & Speaks About His Baby Son</h4>
        <p>Drake just admitted that he once wanted to start a family with Rihanna. “As life takes shape and teaches you your own lessons, I end up in this situation where I don’t have the fairy tale, like, ‘Oh, Drake started a family with Rihanna and this is like so perfect’…it looks so good on paper,” the rapper, 31, said during an interview with LeBron James and  Maverick Carter on the new HBO series The Shop on Oct. 12. “By the way, I wanted that too at one time.”

        While Drizzy didn’t end up having kids with the “Wild Thoughts” singer, he did have a son with French artist and former adult film star Sophie Brussaux. In 2017, she gave birth to their son, Adonis, which Drake confirmed was his on his track, “March 14,” off his June 2018 album, Scorpion.
        “I have a son, he’s a beautiful boy,” he said as she showed LeBron a photo of the baby on his phone. “Crazy blue eyes, bro,” the NBA star responded. “Crazy blue eyes, baby blue eyes,” Drake said. “You know he’s already in the pool like shooting the basketball. He’s gonna get to a certain age, I’m gonna bring him right to ‘Bron’s house and I’ma be like, ‘Yo, summer camp at Bronny’s house!”

        <h4>Chris Evans reveals details of his last scene as Captain America</h4>
        <p>Finishing a film, and especially finishing a film that might be (if very plausible rumors are to be believed) your last outing in a long film franchise, sounds exciting, right? Doing one last big scene, putting a capper on an incredible experience.

For Chris Evans and his iconic role as the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Captain America, ahh, not so much. In an interview, as quoted by Comic Book Resources, Evans explained how his final day as Steve Rogers was, well, pretty forgettable, honestly.

His last line? “It was something really stupid, it was something really dumb,” he said. “Which I also probably can’t give away. Well, you know, it was reshoots, so you’re doing these little picks and pops, and it’s just little things that they need. It might have been a line to Paul Rudd. He wasn’t there, but it was a stupid line. The line wasn’t memorable to me [laughs]. The day was more memorable than the line.”

So much for a climax, huh? I like this quote because it also sheds light on the way reshoots actually go, where, often, instead of big film-changing modifications they’re just little bits of connective tissue, small things that need filling in. Little, as Evans would say, really stupid lines or movements or re-staged scenes.

Well, at least it won’t be the last line fans see, when they remember Captain America. Probably.
